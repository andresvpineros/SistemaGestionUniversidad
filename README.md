<h1>University Management System</h1>

<h2>📚 Description</h2>

This project is a <b>University Management System</b>, developed in C#, designed to help manage information related to schools, professors, courses, and students within a university environment. The system supports various operations, such as registering schools, assigning professors, managing courses, and enrolling students.

The project is written in Spanish to facilitate understanding, as it is intended for educational purposes in a university setting. The goal is to provide a simple, interactive console-based application that allows users to manage a university's academic structure.

<h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>

This project was developed with university learning objectives in mind. It aims to demonstrate key object-oriented programming concepts, such as:

- Inheritance: Different types of people (e.g., Professor, Student) share common attributes but have distinct roles.
- Aggregation and Composition: Relationships between objects, such as a professor being part of multiple schools, or a course belonging to a department.
- Data Validation: Ensuring that the input provided by users (e.g., names, IDs) is valid and does not duplicate existing entries.

<h2>📝 Usage</h2>

The system presents a series of interactive menus where users can:

- Add new entities such as schools, professors, and courses.
- Assign relationships between entities (e.g., assigning professors to schools).
- View registered data, such as the list of schools, courses, and professors.
  
The system is designed to handle basic input validation and allows users to return to the main menu without crashing or restarting.
